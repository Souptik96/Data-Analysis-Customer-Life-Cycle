# Customer Life Cycle Value Analysis with Plotly Express

## Project Overview
Customer Life Cycle Value (CLV) analysis is a crucial practice in the world of business. It involves estimating the total value that a customer is expected to bring to a company throughout their entire relationship. CLV analysis is a powerful tool for making informed decisions about customer acquisition, retention, and marketing strategies. In this project, we have harnessed the capabilities of the Plotly Express library to perform comprehensive CLV analysis and present the results in an interactive and engaging visual format.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project provides information about customer transactions, purchases, and interactions with a business. It serves as the foundation for understanding customer behavior, making predictions, and ultimately optimizing the business's strategies for customer engagement. The dataset can be downloaded from: https://statso.io/customer-lifetime-value-analytics-case-study/

## Key Objectives
1. **Data Exploration**: We begin by thoroughly exploring the dataset to understand its structure, relevant variables, and potential insights it holds.

2. **CLV Estimation**: We employ data-driven methods to estimate Customer Life Cycle Value, allowing us to predict the future value of customers based on their historical interactions with the business.

3. **Visualization with Plotly Express**: The primary focus of this project is on the use of Plotly Express for interactive data visualization. We leverage the library's features to create insightful and visually appealing charts that convey the results of our CLV analysis.

4. **Insights and Recommendations**: We present findings and recommendations based on the CLV analysis, showcasing the potential for increasing customer engagement, identifying high-value customers, and enhancing marketing strategies.

## Interactive Visualizations
Plotly Express offers a wide range of interactive visualizations, including line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, and more. These interactive charts enable users to explore and understand customer behavior and CLV patterns with ease.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed, including Plotly Express and any other libraries specified in the project's environment.
3. Open the provided Jupyter notebook or Python script to run and interact with the CLV analysis and Plotly Express visualizations.

## Acknowledgments
We acknowledge the valuable dataset that serves as the foundation for this project's analysis. Additionally, we appreciate the contributions of the Plotly Express library in creating engaging and informative visualizations.
